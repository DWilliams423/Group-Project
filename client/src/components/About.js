                    My name is Some Guy, and I created a food blogto celebrate how nourishing, fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. I hope that the recipes here inspire you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way.
                    You’ll find a host of inventive vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I also want a food blogto be a resource for you. We have guides to working with vegetables ranging from spaghetti squash to asparagus and tips for cooking plant-based basics like quinoa, rice, and lentils.
                </p>
                <p>And after all those veggies, I always save room for dessert! In my opinion, healthy eating is all about balance, so you’ll find recipes for brownies, cakes, cookies, and more here too.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
                <p><b> Do I have to be vegetarian to enjoy the recipes?</b>
                    <br />
                    Nope! My meat-eating husband Jack is my #1 taste tester, and he gives each recipe his stamp of approval before I share it. In addition, many of my friends, family, and recipe testers are not vegetarian, and they all try these recipes. Everything you see here is 100% omnivore-approved! When you’re cooking with good-quality seasonal ingredients, the results are going to taste great, whether you’re vegetarian or not.

                <p><b> Do you have a cookbook?</b>
                    <br />
                    Not yet, but something is in the works. Stay tuned! </p>

                <p><b>Where do you grocery shop?</b>
                    <br />
                    In the summertime, we have fantastic local farmers markets and CSA options but, these markets aren’t open year-round. In the winter, I shop at a nearby ALDI, Whole Foods, and/or Trader Joe’s.</p>

                <p><b>What’s your favorite food?</b>
                    <br />
                    Juicy summer peaches are my all-time favorite food. (If you’re lucky enough to have some right now, try them in my peach cobbler or peach sangria. Sweet Corn is a close second.
